When you turn on your tap, you expect the water to be pure, safe, and tasty. To safeguard this, the State of Washington requires Sammamish Plateau Water to require the installation and annual testing of all backflow prevention assemblies to protect the public water supply from contamination. Our records indicate that we have not yet received the annual test results for your backflow prevention assembly(ies) referenced below. COVID-19/Coronavirus Update: During these challenging and difficult times, you may wonder why the District is reaching out to you regarding the backflow prevention assembly(ies) installed on your system. While a number of governmental services and regulations have been curtailed during the COVID-19 crisis, the State of Washington is requiring that we continue to require our customers to perform the annual testing of their backflow prevention assemblies. Our water distribution systems are considered critical infrastructure, and many activities needed to keep them operational are still considered essential functions by the Washington State Department of Health. This includes the testing of backflow-prevention assemblies, which remains important, now more than ever. We understand that it may be difficult during this period to find a state-certified backflow assembly tester, so we are offering a grace-period extension to complete the process. Your new due date is reflected in this letter. Please do your best to contact a state-certified tester to ensure that the test results will be submitted to the District by DECEMBER 31ST 2021. If you have other backflow prevention assemblies on your property that are not listed, they will also need to be tested at this time. Fora list of state-certified testers, please visit spwater.org/crossconnection. If a state-certified tester has already completed your backflow prevention assembly test(s), please contact us to verify that the test reports have been properly submitted to the District. If you have other backflow prevention assemblies on your property that are not listed, they will also need to be tested at this time.

The notice provides you with important information about the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. Please read the information below about the act and notify American Family if you wish to change your previous decision regarding acceptance or rejection of the coverage for ""certified acts of terrorism."" Some Background On Nov. 26, 2002, President Bush signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act into law, which requires insurance carriers to make coverage available to policyholders for losses due to ""certified acts of terrorism."" This law has been reauthorized since then, and the latest reauthorization occurred in January of 2015 when President Obama signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 into law. The most recent reauthorization extends the current program for six years. As an American Family customer, you have the right, under the recently reauthorized law, to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from ""certified acts of terrorism,"" which are defined as: any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism. The criteria contained in that law for certifying an act of terrorism includes the following: e The act is a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; ¢ The act results in aggregate property and casualty insurance losses in excess of $5 million; and ¢ The act is committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. Further Explanation Where coverage is provided under the act for losses resulting from ""certified acts of terrorism,"" such losses may be partially reimbursed by the United States Government as established by the act. You should also understand that your policy may contain exclusions (not part of the act) that might affect your coverage. For example, if a ""certified act of terrorism"" occurs and results in damage that you're not covered for under other portions of your policy, the terrorism coverage may not apply to the loss because you need to have underlying coverage to qualify for a ""certified act of terrorism"" loss covered by the act. You should also be aware that the reauthorized act contains a $100 billion cap that limits United States Government reimbursement as well as insurers' liability for losses resulting from “certified acts of terrorism"" to $100 billion per calendar year. What this means is, if the combined insured losses for all insurers exceeds $100 billion, your coverage may be reduced due to the cap. PLO-28629 Ed. 1/15 Page 1 of 2",insurance

The notice provides you with important information about the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015. Please read the information below about the act and notify American Family if you wish to change your previous decision regarding acceptance or rejection of the coverage for ""certified acts of terrorism."" Some Background On Nov. 26, 2002, President Bush signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act into law, which requires - insurance carriers to make coverage available to policyholders for losses due to “certified acts of terrorism."" This law has been reauthorized since then, and the latest reauthorization occurred in January of 2015 when President Obama signed the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 into law. The most recent reauthorization extends the current program for six years. As an American Family customer, you have the right, under the recently reauthorized law, to purchase insurance coverage for losses resulting from “certified acts of terrorism,” which are defined as: any act that is certified by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States, to be an act of terrorism. The criteria contained in that law for certifying an act of terrorism includes the following: e The act is a violent act or an act that is dangerous to human life, property or infrastructure; ¢ The act results in aggregate property and casualty insurance losses in excess of $5 million; and ¢ The act is committed by an individual or individuals as part of an effort to coerce the civilian population of the United States or to influence the policy or affect the conduct of the United States Government by coercion. Further Explanation Where coverage is provided under the act for losses resulting from ""certified acts of terrorism,"" such losses may be partially reimbursed by the United States Government as established by the act. You should also understand that your policy may contain exclusions (not part of the act) that might affect your coverage. For example, if a ""certified act of terrorism"" occurs and results in damage that you're not covered for under other portions of your policy, the terrorism coverage may not apply to the loss because you need to have underlying coverage to qualify for a ""certified act of terrorism"" loss covered by the act. You should also be aware that the reauthorized act contains a $100 billion cap that limits United States Government reimbursement as well as insurers’ liability for losses resulting from “certified acts of terrorism"" to $100 billion per calendar year. What this means is, if the combined insured losses for all insurers exceeds $100 billion, your coverage may be reduced due to the cap. PLO-28831 Ed. 1/15 Page 1 of 2",insurance

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes thé design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. Auditor’s Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion ‘on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards. generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to. obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amourits and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment. of the risks of material misstatemerit of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity's preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

Such information, although not a part of the basic financial statements, is required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, who considers it to be an essential part-of financial reporting for placing basic financial statements in an appropriate operational, economic, or historical context. We have applied certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information. in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America, which consisted. of inquiries of management. about the methods. of preparing the information and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial: statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic. financial statements.

NOTE C-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Fund Accounting The Association’s governing documents. provide certain guidelines for governing its financial activities. To ensure observance of limitations and restrictions-on the use of financial resources, the. Association maintains its accounts using fund accounting. Financial resources are classified for accounting and reporting purposes in the following. funds established according to their nature and purpose: Operating Furnd-This fund ts used to account for the financial resources available for the general operations of the Association. Replacement Fund-This fund is: used: to accumulate financial resources designated for future major repairs and replacements, insurance proceeds (if any}, insurance repairs (if any), and litigation costs (if any) relating to the afore mentioned proceeds. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Association considers cash on deposit, cash on hand, money market funds (if any) and certificates of deposit (if any} and any other highly-liquid securities to be cash and or cash equivalents. Any penalties for early withdrawal would not have a material effect on the financial statements. See Independent Auditor’s Report and Notes to Financial Statements Page 6 CHANNEL PLACE COMMUNITY CLUB NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31,2020 NOTE C-SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT. ACCOUNTING POLICIES-CONTINUED (Viem ber Assessments Association members are subject to monthly assessments. to provide funds for the Association's operating expenses, future capital acquisitions, and major repairs and replacements. Assessments. receivable at the balance sheet date represent fees due from unit owners. The Association’s policy is: to retain legal counsel and place liens on the properties of homeowners whose assessments are deliriquent. Any excess assessments at year end are retained by the Association for use in the succeeding year. If assessments are inadequate, the Board of Directors, subject to the limitations of their authority described in the Association’s governing. documents, may have to increase regular assessments or pass special assessments. At December 31, 2020, the Association had. assessments delinquent 90 days or more of $2,717. Property and Equipment Real property and common areas acquired from the developer and related improvements to. such property are not recorded in the Association’s financial statements because those properties are owned by individual unit owners in common and not by the Association. The Association capitalizes: personal.property at cost and depreciates.it using the straight-line method. Estimates The preparation of financial statements. in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. of assets and liabilities. and disclosure. of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and-expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. NOTE D-COMMITMENTS The Association has various contracts for services including but not limited to management, maintenance, and landscaping. See Independent Auditor’s Report and Notes to Financial Statements. Page 7 CHANNEL PLACE COMMUNITY CLUB NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020. NOTE E-INCOME TAXES Condominium Associations may be taxed either as homeowners” Associations ‘or as regular corporations. in 2020, the.Association elected to be taxed as a homeowners’ Association. Under that election, the Association is taxed on its nonexempt function. income, such as net interest earnings, at a fiat rate of 30%. Exempt function income, which consisis..primarily of member assessments, is not taxable. As of December 31, 2020, the tax years that remain subject to examination by taxing authorities begin with 2017. NOTE F-FUTURE MAJOR REPAIRS AND REPLACEMENTS The Association’s governing documents require funds:to be accumulated for future major repairs and replacements. Accumulated funds (assets less liabilities as reported on the balance sheet), which in aggregate are a deficit of approximately ($176;319) at December 31, 2020, are held in separate accounts.and are generally not available for.operating purposes. Cash balances. shown on the balance sheet that are part of these funds are held in separate bank accounts. The Association engaged a specialist who conducted a‘study update in 2016:to estimate the remaining useful lives and the replacement costs of the common property components. The Association is partially funding for-such major repairs and replacements over the estimated lives of the components based on the study’s estimates of current replacement costs, considering amounts. previously accumulated in the replacement fund. Actual expenditures, however, may vary from the estimated amounts and the variations. may be material. Therefore, amounts accumulated in the replacement fund may not be adequate to meet future needs. lf additional funds are needed, however, the Association has the right, subject to the limitations of the authority described in the Association’s: governing documents, to increase regular assessments or levy special assessments, or it may delay major repairs.and replacements until funds are available.

,"s Sammamish Plateau Water lameness Main: 425.392.6256 Fax: 425.391.5389 www.spwater.org September 21, 2021 RESERVE AT INGLEWOOD C/O PROPVIVO INC 2018 156TH AVE NE BELLEVUE WA 98007 RE: ACCOUNT # 00029891-00 Dear RESERVE AT INGLEWOOD C/O PROPVIVO INC: Did you know that your water meter knows when there’s a possible leak? Your meter relays information that can detect continuous water use that may indicate a potential leak before it becomes critical and costly. Taking advantage of this technology, we follow a leak notification process to help you find and fix leaks right away. Our system has alerted us that your account is experiencing continuous hourly water use of approximately .7 cubic feet /5.24 gallons, which may indicate a leak. The approximate cost to you of a leak this size if left unchecked for 20 days would be in a range of $ 7.00 to $27.00 based on the usage block rate (rates increase with higher levels of use). It works like this: your meter is equipped with a transmitter that provides data that we read prior to generating your bill. Every day, the meter transmits usage, and sends us an alert when it has registered a period of at least 95 hours of continuous use — possibly indicating a water leak. Because your meter triggered an alert, we are sending you this leak notification letter. This is actually good news! Instead of waiting for your next bill to identify a potential leak, we are able to notify you within a few days. We encourage all of our customers to investigate any potential leak right away, as initial repair costs could end up saving money because a leak can steadily increase over time. Please register for MySPWater™ We strongly encourage you to register your account with MySPWater™ — our new online water management program that puts valuable tools in your hands to monitor your water use, set up usage notifications, track your daily usage, pay bills online, and communicate more directly with our customer service staff. More information means increased awareness, which can result in less water consumed, less water wasted and more money saved at home. All you need to do to register is visit myspwater.org or download the mobile app on either Google Play or the Apple App Store and register. You will need your account number, meter number, zip code, and an email address to register. We recommend that you review the attached suggested process for identifying potential leaks. Please note, Sammamish Plateau Water is responsible for maintaining and replacing water mains throughout Our service area, while you are responsible for any water use (including leaks) between the water meter and your house. We're happy to answer any questions you may have. You can contact us at (425) 392- 6256. Sincerely, Customer service Attachment SUGGESTED PROCESS FOR IDENTIFYING POTENTIAL LEAKS If your water is not being used, it may indicate that you have a leak. This suspected leak could be in your service line, your house, or your irrigation (watering) system if you have one. It may be something as simple as a toilet that is running quietly undetected. If you follow these steps, you may discover the issue and avoid having to call a professional. Do | have a leak? First, make sure you are not using any water. Next, identify your water meter, usually on a property corner or property line. Open the meter box and raise the lid on the meter. To be sure you have located the correct meter, you may match the meter number on your bill to the number on the meter After raising the meter lid, an LED number display should appear. You may need to shine a light on the photo eyes . Once the display activates, notice if the numbers are rising, indicating water is flowing. If you are not seeing the meter numbers change, please contact us. Finding the Leak — Is it in my watering system, the lines bringing water to my home, or in my house? If you have a lawn or garden watering system, isolate the system by using the two vaives iocated on each end of your backflow preventer (usually a double check valve assembly). Test whether the shut-off valves are working by opening one of the test ports between the two shut-offs. Once the initial pressure is relieved, no water should flow from the test port. Return to the meter. If the meter reading has stopped increasing, the leak may be in your watering system. At this point, you may make the repair or contact a qualified repair professional. If the meter is continuing to increase, or if you do not have a watering system, the leak may be in your home or the line bringing water to your house. Next, turn off the main house water valve and verify your valve is working by going to the highest point of the plumbing system, usually an upstairs bathroom sink. Turn on the cold water until the water stops flowing. Shut the fixture off for about 30 seconds, then turn it on again. If substantial pressure has built up, or if the fixture flows a considerable amount of water, it may be an indication that the main house valve is not working properly and should be addressed. However, if there is no additional flow or pressure, return to the meter and check for the upward movement of the reading. lf the meter reading has stopped increasing, it may be an indicator that the possible leak is in your home. Check your toilet by using dye strips/tablets in the tanks or remove the tank lid for a thorough evaluation. The flapper valve (in the bottom of tank) should be securely seated and allowing no water to seep into the bowl. The water level in the tank should be %” to %” from the top of the overflow tube. If the reading on the meter continues to increase, you may have a leak is in the service line between the water meter and the house, usually at connection points or splices. At this time, you may continue to investigate further or you may contact qualified leak detection or repair professional.",other

When you turn on your tap, you expect the water to be pure, safe, and tasty. To safeguard this, the State of Washington requires Sammamish Plateau Water to require the installation and annual testing of all backflow prevention assemblies to protect the public water supply from contamination. COVID-19/Coronavirus Update: During these challenging and difficult times, you may wonder why the District is reaching out to you regarding the backflow prevention assembly(ies) installed on your system. While a number of governmental services and regulations have been curtailed during the COVID-19 crisis, the State of Washington is requiring that we continue to require our customers to perform the annual testing of their backflow prevention assemblies. Our water distribution systems are considered critical infrastructure, and many activities needed to keep them operational are still considered essential functions by the Washington State Department of Health. This includes the testing of backflow-prevention assemblies, which remains important, now more than ever. Your device has an assigned test month of 10 - October. We understand it may be difficult during this period to find a state-certified backflow assembly tester, so we are offering a grace-period extension to complete the process. Your new due date is reflected in this letter. Please do your best to contact a state-certified tester to ensure that the test results will be submitted to the District by DECEMBER 31ST 2021. If you have other backflow prevention assemblies on your property that are not listed, they will also need to be tested at this time. For more information on cross connection and backflow prevention, please visit spwater.org/crossconnection. You can also email us at crossconnection@spwater.org with questions or concerns.
